# Modeling of flying insects' central complex with a spiking neural network

*This work was part of my Bachelor's thesis for my Degree on Biomedical Engineering at UC3M. The MATLAB codes used are provided, together with the final thesis report and a presentation. Feel free to contact me at josu.ps13@gmail.com for further information.*

My project at NISL was focused on the construction of a virtual network that simulates the spiking behavior of neurons in the central complex (CX) of flying insects. Once I acquired the necessary knowledge, I started to build a spiking neural network based on the methods of some specific publications that were provided, with the aim of reproducing the same results. Once the network was functional, my goal was to compare the CX of two insects (fruit fly vs. honeybee, but was later changed to fruit fly vs. locust) and infer their differences in anatomy of the brain region, performance of the network and behavior of the real animals. An additional analysis would consist on adding noise to each connection to quantitatively measure their importance in the network, but constraints in time and computational power prevented the realization of that analysis.
